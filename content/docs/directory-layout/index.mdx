title: Directory Layout
description: Understand the standard structure of a Grace workflow workspace.
---

When you initialize a new Grace project using [`grace init`](/docs/cli-reference/init), or when you structure a project manually, Grace expects a certain directory layout. This standardized structure helps keep your workflow definitions, source code, and Grace's operational outputs organized and predictable.

A typical Grace workflow workspace looks like this:

```sh
your-workflow-name/
├── .grace/               # Internal directory for Grace's operational files
│   ├── deck/             # Stores JCL generated by 'grace deck'
│   └── logs/             # Stores logs & summaries from 'grace run / grace submit'
├── src/                  # Your application source code (COBOL, PL/I, etc.)
└── grace.yml             # Your declarative workflow definition
```

Understanding each component will help you effectively manage and version your Grace projects.

# Best practices

- **Version control:** It's highly recommended to commit your `grace.yml` and the contents of your `src/` directory to a version control system like Git.
- **`.gitignore`:** The `.grace/` directory (and its subdirectories `deck/` and `logs/`) are typically generated by Grace and can often be added to your `.gitignore` file, as they can be reproduced by running `grace deck` or `grace run`. However, you might choose to commit `.grace/deck/` if you manually fine-tune JCL there and use `grace deck --no-compile`.
- **Clarity:** Maintaining this structure makes it easier for team members to understand and contribute to Grace workflows.
