description: Understand the purpose of the src/ directory in a Grace workflow.
---

In a Grace workspace, the `src/` directory is the conventional location for storing your application source code and related artifacts that you intend for Grace to manage and potentially upload to the mainframe.

An example structure:

```sh
your-workflow-name/
├── .grace/
│ └── ...
├── src/ # <-- Your application source files
│ ├── myprogram.cbl
│ ├── anotherprog.cpy
│ ├── localscript.sh
│ └── localparams.txt # (if used by a local shell script, for instance)
└── grace.yml
```

---

# Purpose

The primary purpose of the `src/` directory is to hold files that are referenced in your `grace.yml` job definitions using the `src://` virtual path prefix.

- **Mainframe source code:** This typically includes COBOL programs, PL/I programs, Assembler source, copybooks, includes, BMS maps, MFS screens, etc. When referenced by a `compile` job or similar, Grace will upload these to the z/OS dataset specified in your [datasets.src](/docs/yaml-spec/datasets#src) configuration (or a [job-level override](/docs/yaml-spec/jobs#overrides)).
- **Scripts for `shell` jobs:** If a `shell` job type uses `with.script: src://myscript.sh`, Grace will look for `myscript.sh` in the `src/` directory.
- **Other local files:** You can also organize other local files here that might be used as inputs by `shell` job steps or other local processing, although no strict rule enforces this beyond convention.

# How Grace uses `src://`

When a job input in your `grace.yml` specifies a path like `path: src://myprogram.cbl`:

1.  **Local Path Resolution:** Grace constructs a local file path by looking for `myprogram.cbl` inside the `src/` directory, relative to the location of your `grace.yml` file. So, it would look for `your-workflow-name/src/myprogram.cbl`.
2.  **Upload to Mainframe (for z/OS job types):** During the `grace deck` command (unless `--no-upload` is specified), if this `src://` path is an input to a z/OS job type (like `compile`), Grace will:
    - Derive a PDS member name from the filename (e.g., `myprogram.cbl` becomes `MYPROGRAM`).
    - Upload the local file `src/myprogram.cbl` to the PDS member `datasets.src(MYPROGRAM)` on your z/OS system.
3.  **JCL Generation:** The generated JCL for the job will then reference this uploaded member (e.g., `//SYSIN DD DSN=YOUR.HLQ.SRC(MYPROGRAM),DISP=SHR`).

If a `shell` job uses `with.script: src://myscript.sh`, Grace will simply use the local path `src/myscript.sh` to execute the script.

## Example `grace.yml` usage

```yaml
# In your grace.yml

datasets:
  src: MYUSER.PROJECT.SOURCE # Target PDS on z/OS for src:// uploads

jobs:
  - name: COMPILEPGM
    type: compile
    inputs:
      - name: SYSIN # Standard DDName for compiler input
        path: src://mycobol.cbl
        # Grace looks for ./src/mycobol.cbl and uploads it to MYUSER.PROJECT.SOURCE(MYCOBOL)
    outputs:
      - name: SYSLIN
        path: zos-temp://myprog.obj

  - name: RUNSCRIPT
    type: shell
    with:
      script: src://helpers/setup.sh # Grace looks for ./src/helpers/setup.sh locally
```

# Best practices

- Keep your application source code directly related to the workflow within the `src/` directory.
- If you have common copybooks or includes shared across many projects, consider if they should be managed centrally on the mainframe and referenced via `zos://COMMON.COPYLIB(MYCOPY)` in your grace.yml inputs, rather than duplicating them in every Grace project's `src/` folder. However, for project-specific, version-controlled source, `src://` is ideal.
- Ensure filenames within `src/` (especially those destined for PDS members like COBOL programs) can be translated into valid PDS member names (typically uppercase, 1-8 characters, no problematic special characters beyond what your site allows). Grace will attempt to convert `myprogram.cbl` to `MYPROGRAM`.
