{/* # Install via `curl`

You can install Grace in one line using our install script:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://graceinfra.org/install.sh | sh
```

This script will:

- Detect your OS and architecture
- Download the latest compatible binary from GitHub
- Install it to `/usr/local/bin/grace`

Once it's done, verify with:

```sh
grace --version
```

# Install from GitHub Releases
