title: Execute
description: Defining an 'execute' job module in your grace.yml to run programs or batch jobs on z/OS.
---

The `execute` job module is used to run a pre-compiled and linked executable program (load module) or a batch job on z/OS. This is typically the final step in a compile-link-execute sequence or a standalone step to run existing batch applications.

Grace uses settings from the global [`config.defaults.linker`](/docs/yaml-spec/config#defaults) for `STEPLIB` context if it's generating JCL, although `execute` jobs don't directly use linker-specific overrides. The primary program execution context is defined by the `program` field and the [`datasets.loadlib`](/docs/yaml-spec/datasets#loadlib).

```yaml
jobs:
  # (Assuming a preceding linkedit job named LNKMYPGM that created MYPROG in datasets.loadlib)

  - name: RUNMYPGM
    type: execute
    program: MYPROG # Name of the program to execute from datasets.loadlib
    depends_on: [LNKMYPGM]
    jcl: file://custom_execute.jcl.tmpl # Optional: Use a custom JCL template

    inputs:
      - name: SYSIN # Input control cards or data for MYPROG
        path: src://myrun.cards

      - name: CUSTFILE
        path: zos://PROD.MASTER.DATA(CURRENT)
        disp: SHR

    outputs:
      - name: SYSPRINT
        path: zos-temp://run_report.txt
        dcb: "RECFM=FBA,LRECL=133"

      - name: DATAOUT
        path: zos://ARCHIVE.DAILY.OUTPUT(+1) # GDG example
        disp: "(NEW,CATLG,DELETE)"
        space: "(CYL,(10,2),RLSE)"
```

While `execute` jobs use [common job fields](/docs/yaml-spec/jobs) and [z/OS specific fields](/docs/yaml-spec/jobs/zos-specifics), the following are particularly relevant for `type: execute`.

---

## `type`

```yaml
type: execute
```

- **Value:** `execute` (Required)
- **Description:** Identifies this job as a program execution task. Grace will use its internal `ZosExecuteHandler` to manage its execution.

---

## `program`

```yaml
program: MYPROG
```

- **Type:** `String`
- **Required:** Yes
- **Description:** Specifies the **name of the executable program (load module)** to run.
  - This name must adhere to [PDS member naming conventions](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/3.1.0?topic=conventions-data-set-naming-rules).
  - Grace's default JCL template for `execute` jobs will look for this program in the `STEPLIB`, which by default points to the `datasets.loadlib` defined [globally](/docs/yaml-spec/datasets#loadlib) or via a job-level [override](/docs/yaml-spec/jobs#overrides).
  - This value is also available as `{{ .ProgramName }}` in JCL templates for the `PGM=` parameter of the `EXEC` statement.

---

## `jcl` (Optional)

```yaml
jcl: zos://PROD.COMMON.JCL(STDEXEC)
```

- **Type:** `String`
- **Description:** Specifies the source of the JCL for this execute job.
  - **Omitted:** Grace uses its internal default `execute.jcl.tmpl` template.
  - `file://path/to/your_exec.jcl[.tmpl]`: Uses your local JCL file (static or [templated](/docs/jcl-templates)).
  - `zos://MY.PDS.JCL(RUNJCL)`: Uses an existing JCL member on the mainframe.

> See [z/OS Job Specifics](/docs/yaml-spec/jobs/zos-specifics) and [JCL Templates](/docs/jcl-templates) for more details.

---

## `overrides` (Optional)

- **Description:** While the `overrides` block exists, the `compiler` and `linker` sub-sections within it are not directly used by the `execute` job handler itself when it generates JCL **using its default template** (as it's not compiling or linking). **However**, if you provide a custom JCL template (`jcl: file://`) that _happens_ to use variables like `{{ .CompilerPgm }}` for some reason, those could still be resolved from defaults or overrides.

> Generally, `overrides` are not a primary concern for `type: execute` jobs.

---

## `inputs`

```yaml
inputs:
  - name: SYSIN
    path: src://runtime.params

  - name: TRANSREC
    path: zos-temp://transformed.data # Output from a previous step
    disp: OLD # This dataset must exist
```

- **Description:** Defines the data inputs required by the program being executed. These typically map to DD statements in the JCL.
- **Common `name` (DDName) values:**
  - `SYSIN`: Often used for runtime parameters, control cards, or inline data
  - Application-specific DDNames (e.g. `CUSTMAST`, `TRANFILE`, `PARMLIB`)
- **Path sources can be varied:**
  - `src://` for local files uploaded by Grace
  - `zos-temp://` for intermediate datasets from prior Grace jobs
  - `zos://` for preexisting mainframe datasets

> See [Virtual Paths & Job I/O](/docs/yaml-spec/virtual-paths) for details on `path` prefixes and defining input paramenters like `disp`.

---

## `outputs`

```yaml
outputs:
  - name: SYSOUT
    path: zos-temp://job_sysout.log
    keep: true

  - name: RPTFILE
    path: zos://MONTHLY.SALES.REPORT(+1) # Writing to a GDG
    disp: "(NEW,CATLG,DELETE)"
    space: "(CYL,(50,10),RLSE)"
    dcb: "RECFM=FB,LRECL=132,BLKSIZE=27998"
```

- **Description:** Defines the datasets that the executed program will create or write to. These map to output DD statements in the JCL.
- **Common `name` (DDName) values:**
  - `SYSOUT`, `SYSPRINT`: For standard job output listings or application reports.
  - Application-specific DDNames (e.g. `NEWMAST`, `ERRFILE`, `SUMMRPT`).
- **Output paths can be:**
  - `zos-temp://` for Grace-managed temporary datasets
  - `zos://` for persistent datasets
  - `file://` if the workflow involves downloading the output later via a subsequent `shell` job.

> See [Virtual Paths & Job I/O](/docs/yaml-spec/virtual-paths) for details on `path` prefixes and defining output paramenters like `disp`, `space`, `dcb`, and `keep`.

# JCL generation context

When Grace generates JCL for an execute job (either using its internal template or a user-provided `jcl: file://` template), the following specific data is made available, in addition to common job data and resolved I/O:

- `{{ .ProgramName }}`: The name of the program to be executed (from [`job.program`](#program))
- `{{ .LoadLib }}`: The DSN of the load library where `ProgramName` is expected to reside (from [`datasets.loadlib`](/docs/yaml-spec/datasets#loadlib) or a job-level override). This is typically used for the `STEPLIB DD` in the JCL.

> Refer to the [JCL Templating Guide](/docs/jcl-templates) for a full list of variables available in JCL templates.

---

# Behavior notes

- **Program location:** The program specified in `job.program` must exist in the `STEPLIB` concatenation (typically the `datasets.loadlib` or system libraries like `LINKLST`/`LPA`). If Grace generates the JCL, it will include a `STEPLIB DD` pointing to the resolved load library. If you provide custom JCL, **you are responsible for ensuring the correct `STEPLIB` is defined**.
- **Dependencies:** `execute` jobs often depend on `linkedit` jobs that create the program to be run, or other jobs that prepare input data. Ensure you include necessary dependencies in this job's [`depends_on`](/docs/yaml-spec/jobs#depends_on) field.
- **Return codes:** The success or failure of an `execute` job is determined by the return code of the executed program. `CC 0000` is typically success. Grace monitors these return codes.

The `execute` job module is fundamental for running your compiled applications and existing batch processes as part of a Grace-managed workflow.
