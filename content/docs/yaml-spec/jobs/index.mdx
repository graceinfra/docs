title: Jobs
description: Define the individual steps of your workflow within the 'jobs' block of grace.yml.
---

The `jobs` block in your `grace.yml` file is where the core logic of your workflow is defined. It's an array of `job` objects, where each object represents a distinct step in your automation pipeline.

Grace executes these jobs based on their defined order, dependencies, and types, orchestrating operations across z/OS and other platforms (like the host machine for `shell` jobs).

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: RUNPROG
    type: execute
    program: MYPROG
    inputs:
      - name: PARMIN
        path: zos://PROD.PARMLIB(RUNX)
    outputs:
      - name: REPORT
        path: zos-temp://runprog.report.txt

  - name: PROCESSREP
    type: shell
    depends_on: [RUNPROG]
    with:
      script: scripts/cpyreport.sh
    inputs:
      - name: REPORTFILE
        path: zos-temp://runprog.report.txt
    outputs:
      - name: LOCALRPT
        path: file://./reports/final_run_report.txt
```

# Job definition structure

Each entry in the `jobs` array is a YAML object that defines a single job. All jobs share a set of common fields, while some fields are specific to certain job types. For more information on job-specific fields, refer to their individual pages under [YAML Specification - Jobs](/docs/yaml-spec/jobs).

---

# Required fields

## `name`

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: BUILD01
```

- **Type:** `String`
- **Required:** Yes
- **Description:** A unique name for this job within the workflow. This name is crucial for several reasons:
  - **Dependency tracking:** Other jobs will refer to this name in their `depends_on` list.
  - **JCL member naming:** For z/OS job types (`compile`, `linkedit`, `execute`), if Grace generates or uploads JCL, the `name` is used as the PDS member name in the `datasets.jcl` PDS.
  - **Logging and reporting:** Used to identify the job in logs, summaries, and terminal output.
- **Constraints:**
  - Must be unique across all jobs in `grace.yml`
  - Must adhere to [z/OS PDS member naming conventions](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/engineering-lifecycle-management-suite/workflow-management/7.1.0?topic=definitions-zos-data-set-naming-rules)

---

## `type`

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: COBSTEP
    type: compile
    # ...
  - name: RUNLOCAL
    type: shell
    # ...
```

- **Type:** `String`
- **Required:** Yes
- **Description:** Specifies the orchestration module this job will use for its execution.
- **Built-in modules:**
  - `compile`: Compiles source code (e.g. COBOL, PL/I) on z/OS.
  - `linkedit`: Link-edits object code into an executable load module on z/OS.
  - `execute`: Executes a program or batch job on z/OS.
  - `shell`: Executes a command or script on the machine from which Grace is orchestrating.

Detailed configurations and specific fields for each job.type are covered in their respective pages under the YAML Specification. (e.g., [Execute Jobs](/docs/yaml-spec/jobs/execute), [Shell Jobs](/docs/yaml-spec/jobs/shell)).

---

# Optional fields

These fields are used to control execution flow and data management.

## `depends_on`

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: JOB_A
    type: compile
    # ...

  - name: JOB_B
    type: linkedit
    depends_on: [JOB_A]
    # ...

  - name: JOB_C
    type: execute
    depends_on: [JOB_A, JOB_B]
    # ...
```

- **Type:** `[]String`
- **Required:** No
- **Description:** Specifies a list of other job `name` values that must complete successfully before this current job can begin execution. This is how you define the sequence and dependencies in your workflow.
  - If a job in the `depends_on` list fails or is skipped, this current job (and any jobs that depend on it) will also be skipped.
  - Grace automatically builds a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) from these dependencies and will detect circular dependencies during validation (`grace lint`).

> In the above example, `JOB_B` will only run after `JOB_A` completes successfully. `JOB_C` will only run after both `JOB_A` and `JOB_B` complete successfully.

---

## `inputs`

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: PROCESSDATA
    type: execute
    depends_on: [STEP1]
    inputs:
      - name: SYSIN
        path: src://control.cards

      - name: CUSTFILE
        path: zos://PROD.CUSTOMER.DATA

      - name: PREVIOUT
        path: zos-temp://step1.output.file # Output from a previous job
        disp: OLD
```

- **Type:** `[]Object`
- **Required:** No
- **Description:** Defines the data inputs required by this job. Each item in the array specifies a named input (often corresponding to a DDName for z/OS jobs) and a virtual mount point indicating the source of the data.
- **Sub-fields:**
  - `name` _(String, Required)_ : The logical name for this input (e.g. `SYSIN`, `COPYBOOK`, `CONFIGFILE`). For z/OS jobs, this becomes the DDName in the JCL.
  - `path` _(String, Required)_ : A [virtual path](#) specifying the location of the input data (e.g. `src://myprog.cbl`, `zos-temp://object.obj`, `zos://PROD.DATA(MEMBER)`, `file://./local_data.txt`).
  - `disp` _(String, Optional, z/OS only)_ : Specifies the JCL `DISP=` subparameter for this DD statement (e.g. `SHR`, `OLD`). Defaults to `SHR` for inputs if not specified.
- **Primary uses:**
  - **Data provisioning for z/OS jobs:** Grace uses this to generate appropriate DD statements in JCL. For `src://` paths, it triggers uploads. For `zos-temp://` paths, it wires up outputs from previous jobs.
  - **Data provisioning for `shell` jobs:** `zos://` or `zos-temp://` inputs are downloaded to a local staging area and made available to local scripts via environment variables that Grace exposes based on the input dataset name. (e.g. `GRACE_INPUT_DDNAME`).

---

## `outputs`

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: GENREPORT
    type: execute
    outputs:
      - name: SYSPRINT
        path: zos-temp://report.listing
        dcb: "RECFM=FBA,LRECL=133"

      - name: ARCHIVED
        path: zos://MONTHLY.REPORTS(OCT23)
        disp: "(NEW,CATLG,KEEP)"

      - name: DEBUGDATA
        path: local-temp://debug_out.txt
        keep: true
```

- **Type:** `[]Object`
- **Required:** No
- **Description:** Defines the data outputs produced by this job. Each item in the array specifies a named output (often corresponding to a DDName for z/OS jobs) and a virtual mount point indicating where the output data should be accessed by consequent jobs or be placed indefinitely.
- **Sub-fields:**
  - `name` _(String, Required)_ : The logical name for this input (e.g. `SYSLIN`, `REPORT`, `ARCHIVE`). For z/OS jobs, this becomes the DDName in the JCL.
  - `path` _(String, Required)_ : A [virtual path](#) specifying the intended location or identifier for the output data.
    - `zos-temp://` - Grace manages the allocation and cleanup of this temporary z/OS dataset. The actual DSN is generated by Grace.
    - `local-temp://` - Grace manages a temporary local file in a staging area.
    - `zos://` - Indicates that the job writes to a specific, persistent z/OS dataset.
    - `file://` - Indicates the job writes to a specific local path.
  - `disp` _(String, Optional, z/OS only)_ : Specifies the JCL `DISP=` subparameter for this DD statement (e.g. `(NEW,CATLG,DELETE)`). Defaults are applied by Grace based on context if not specified.
  - `space` _(String, Optional, z/OS only)_ : Specifies the JCL `SPACE=` parameter for dataset allocation.
  - `dcb` _(String, Optional, z/OS only)_ : Specifies JCL `DCB=` parameters (e.g. `RECFM=FB,LRECL=80`)
  - `keep` _(Boolean, Optional)_ : Grace will not delete this temporary resource during cleanup, even if cleanup is enabled [globally](/docs/yaml-spec/config#cleanup).
- **Primary uses:**
  - **Data definition for z/OS jobs:** Grace uses this to generate appropriate DD statements in JCL for output datasets, including allocation parameters for `zos-temp://` paths.
  - **Data staging for `shell` jobs:** Grace handles cross-platform file transfers for `zos://` or `zos-temp://` paths from a local staging file to the specific mainframe dataset.
  - **Exposing resources downstream:** Declaring outputs makes them available for consumption by subsequent jobs via their virtual paths.

### `overrides`

```yaml
config:
  defaults:
    compiler: # Global compiler defaults
      pgm: IGYCRCTL
      parms: "OBJECT,NODECK,LIB"
      steplib: "SYS1.COBOL.STANDARD.LOADLIB"

jobs:
  - name: SPECIALCOMPILE
    type: compile
    overrides:
      compiler:
        parms: "ADV,RENT,OPTIMIZE(FULL),XREF(SHORT)" # Override parms
        steplib: "MY.SPECIAL.COBOL.LOADLIB" # Override steplib
    inputs:
      - name: SYSIN
        path: src://specialmod.cbl
    # ...

  - name: NORMALCOMPILE
    type: compile # This job will use the global defaults
    inputs:
      - name: SYSIN
        path: src://normalmod.cbl
    # ...
```

- **Type:** `Object`
- **Required:** No
- **Applicable job types:** `compile`, `linkedit`.
- **Description:** Allows you to override the global default settings for compiler or linker toolchains for this specific job. This is useful when a particular compilation or link-edit step requires different parameters, program names, or `STEPLIB`s than those defined in the global [config.defaults](/docs/yaml-spec/config#defaults) section.
- **Sub-fields:**
  - `compiler` _(Object)_ : Overrides for compiler settings. Any fields specified here will take precedence over [config.defaults.compiler](/docs/yaml-spec/config#defaults) for this job.
    - `pgm` _(String, Optional)_ : The specific program name for the compiler for this job (e.g. `IGYCRCTL`).
    - `parms` _(String, Optional)_ : Specific compiler parameters for this job.
    - `steplib` _(String, Optional)_ : Specific `STEPLIB` dataset(s) for this compiler step.
  - `linker` _(Object)_ : Overrides for linkage editor settings. Any fields specified here will take precedence over [config.defaults.linker](/docs/yaml-spec/config#defaults) for this job.
    - `pgm` _(String, Optional)_ : The specific program name for the linkage editor for this job (e.g. `IEWL`).
    - `parms` _(String, Optional)_ : Specific linkage editor parameters for this job.
    - `steplib` _(String, Optional)_ : Specific STEPLIB dataset(s) for this linkage editor step.
- **Behavior:**
  - If a field (e.g. `parms`) is specified within [`job.overrides.compiler`](/docs/yaml-spec/jobs#overrides), it will be used.
  - If it's not specified in `job.overrides.compiler`, Grace will then look at [`config.defaults.compiler`](/docs/yaml-spec/config#defaults).
  - If it's also not in `config.defaults.compiler`, Grace may use an internal hardcoded default (e.g. for `PGM` names like `IGYCRCTL`), though this should avoided.
