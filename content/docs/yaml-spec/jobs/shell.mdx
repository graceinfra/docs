title: Shell
description: Defining a 'shell' job module in your grace.yml to execute local shell commands or scripts.
---

The `shell` job module allows you to execute arbitrary commands or scripts directly on the local machine where the Grace CLI is running. This is extremely useful for integrating non-mainframe tasks into your workflow, such as:

- Pre-processing data before uploading to z/OS.
- Post-processing data downloaded from z/OS.
- Interacting with cloud services (e.g., AWS CLI, Azure CLI, `gcloud`).
- Running custom scripts (Python, Node.js, Bash, etc.) as part of the pipeline.
- Calling other CLI tools.

Shell jobs are executed by the Grace instance itself, not submitted to z/OS.

```yaml
jobs:
  # Example: A shell job doing some local setup
  - name: LOCALSETUP
    type: shell
    with:
      inline: |
        mkdir -p ./staging_area
        echo "OK" > "$GRACE_OUTPUT_SETUPSTATUS"
    outputs:
      - name: SETUPSTATUS # $GRACE_OUTPUT_SETUPSTATUS
        path: file://./staging_area/setup_status.txt

  # Example: A shell job processing a downloaded mainframe file
  - name: PROCESSDATA
    type: shell
    depends_on: [SOME_MAINFRAME_JOB_THAT_PRODUCES_RAWDATA] # Assuming this input comes from some z/OS job
    with:
      script: ./scripts/process_mainframe_data.sh
      # Consumes $GRACE_INPUT_RAWDATA and writes to $GRACE_OUTPUT_PROCESSED and $GRACE_OUTPUT_TOUPLOAD
    inputs:
      - name: RAWDATA # $GRACE_INPUT_RAWDATA
        path: zos-temp://data.from.zos
    outputs:
      - name: PROCESSED # $GRACE_OUTPUT_PROCESSED
        path: local-temp://processed_data.csv
      - name: TOUPLOAD # $GRACE_OUTPUT_TOUPLOAD
        path: zos-temp://final.to.mainframe
```

An example shell script using Grace exposed input/output environment variables:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Processing data from $GRACE_INPUT_RAWDATA"
# ... some processing logic ...
cat "$GRACE_INPUT_RAWDATA" | awk '{print $1 "," $2}' > "$GRACE_OUTPUT_PROCESSED"
echo "Processed data written to $GRACE_OUTPUT_PROCESSED"

echo "This part goes back to mainframe" > "$GRACE_OUTPUT_TOUPLOAD"
echo "File prepared for upload at $GRACE_OUTPUT_TOUPLOAD"
```

> See [Virtual Paths & Job I/O](/docs/yaml-spec/virtual-paths), [`inputs`](#inputs), and [`outputs`](#outputs) for more information on how to use this.

While `shell` jobs use [common job fields](/docs/yaml-spec/jobs) like `name`, `depends_on`, `inputs`, and `outputs` - the `type` and `with` block are central to its definition.

---

## `type`

```yaml
type: shell
```

- **Value:** `shell` (Required)
- **Description:** Identifies this job as a local shell execution task. Grace will use its internal `ShellHandler` to manage execution.

---

## `with` (Required)

The `with` block is required for `shell` jobs and specifies the command or script to be executed. It contains one of the following: `inline` or `script`.

```yaml
with:
  # Choose one: inline or script
  inline: 'echo "Hello from inline shell" > "$GRACE_OUTPUT_MYOUTPUT"'
  # script: "./scripts/my_script.sh"
  shell: "/bin/bash" # Optional: specify the shell to use
```

### `with.inline`

- **Type:** `String` (can be a multi-line string using `|`)
- **Description:** A string containing the shell commands to be executed directly. Multiple commands can be separated by newlines or semicolons as per standard shell syntax.
- **Example (single line)**:
  ```yaml
  with:
    inline: "mkdir -p ./output && touch ./output/result.txt"
  ```
- **Example (multi-line):**
  ```yaml
  with:
    inline: |
      echo "Starting process..."
      sleep 2
      echo "Process complete."
  ```

### `with.script`

- **Type:** `String`
- **Description:** The path to a script file to be executed.
  - The path can be relative to `grace.yml` (e.g. `scripts/my_task.sh`)
  - It can also use the `src://` prefix (e.g. `src://myscript.sh`) to refer to a script within the `src/` directory of your Grace workspace. If `src://` is used, Grace resolves it to the local path; it does **not** upload the script to run on the mainframe for a `shell` job.
- **Example:**
  ```yaml
  with:
    script: ./utils/deploy_to_cloud.py
  ```

### `with.shell` (Optional)

- **Type:** `String`
- **Default:** `sh` (or the system's default shell interpreter)
- **Description:** Specifies the shell interpreter to use for executing `inline` commands or the `script` file.
  - Common values: `sh`, `bash`, `zsh`, `python3`, `node`, etc.
  - If executing a script file (e.g. `.py`, `.js`) that has a shebang (e.g. `#!/usr/bin/env python3`), the shebang will typically take precedence if `with.shell` is not specified or is a generic shell like `sh`. Providing `with.shell: python3` is recommended to make the intent explicit.
- **Example:**
  ```yaml
  with:
    inline: "print('Hello from Python')"
    shell: python3
  ```

> **Important:** You must provide either [`with.inline`](#withinline) or [`with.script`](#withscript), but not both.

---

## `inputs`

```yaml
inputs:
  - name: CONFIG_FILE_TEXT # Example: A JCL or PARMLIB member
    path: zos://PROD.PARMLIB(APPCONF)
    encoding: text # Ensure EBCDIC to local text conversion

  - name: BINARY_DATA_FROM_MF
    path: zos-temp://some.binary.output
    # encoding: binary # Default, or can be explicit

  - name: LOCAL_SCRIPT_PARAM
    path: file://./parameters/script_params.json
```

- **Description:** Defines data inputs for the shell job. For each input, Grace exposes an **environment variable** to your script/commands giving the local path to the data.
- **Environment variable convention:** `GRACE_INPUT_<NAME_IN_UPPERCASE>`
  - e.g. An input with `name: CONFIG_FILE` will be available as `$GRACE_INPUT_CONFIG_FILE`
- **Behavior:**
  - If the `path` is `zos://` or `zos-temp://`, Grace downloads the dataset/member to a temporary local staging file, and the environment variable points to this downloaded copy.
  - You can control the download mode using the optional [`encoding`](/docs/yaml-spec/virtual-paths#encoding) field within the input definition.
  - If the `path` is `file://` or `src://`, the environment variable points directly to that resolved local file.
- **Your script should use these environment variables to access input files:**
  ```bash
  # Inside your script:
  echo "Using config from: $GRACE_INPUT_CONFIG_FILE"
  ./src/process_data --input "$GRACE_INPUT_LOCAL_DATA
  ```

> See [Virtual Paths & Job I/O](/docs/yaml-spec/virtual-paths) for details on `path` prefixes and Grace exposed environment variables.

---

## `outputs`

```yaml
outputs:
  - name: REPORT_DATA # Exposed as $GRACE_OUTPUT_REPORT_DATA
    path: file://./reports/final_report.txt
  - name: ZOS_UPLOAD_FILE # Exposed as $GRACE_OUTPUT_ZOS_UPLOAD_FILE
    path: zos-temp://report.to.mainframe
```

- **Description:** Defines files your shell job is expected to produce. For each output, Grace provides an **environment variable** to your script/commands. This represents the local path where your script **MUST** write the output file.

> Think of this like a contract by your shell job that indicates which resources will be produced for jobs downstream or will reside in the specified locations.

- **Environment variable convention:** `GRACE_OUTPUT_<NAME_IN_UPPERCASE>`
  - Example: An output with `name: REPORT_DATA` means your script should write to `$GRACE_OUTPUT_REPORT_DATA`.
- **Behavior:**
  - Grace determines the appropriate local path for the output based on its `path` definition (e.g., directly for `file://`, or a path in a local staging area for `local-temp://`, `zos://`, and `zos-temp://`).
  - **Your script MUST create and write its output to the file path given by this environment variable.**
  - If the output `path` is `zos://` or `zos-temp://`, Grace will automatically upload the local file (written by your script to `$GRACE_OUTPUT_...`) to the specified dataset after the script completes successfully.
- **Example script usage:**
  ```bash
  # Inside your script:
  generate_report > "$GRACE_OUTPUT_REPORT_DATA"
  echo "Data for mainframe" > "$GRACE_OUTPUT_ZOS_UPLOAD_FILE"
  ```

> See [Virtual Paths & Job I/O](/docs/yaml-spec/virtual-paths) for more on `path` prefixes and Grace exposed environment variables.

# Execution environment

- **Working directory:** Shell commands/scripts execute with the `grace.yml` directory as their working directory.
- **Environment variables:** Inherits Grace CLI's environment, plus the `GRACE_INPUT_*` and `GRACE_OUTPUT_*` variables.

---

# Behavior notes

- **Local execution:** All operations occur on the machine where `grace` is run.
- **Error handling:** Non-zero exit codes from scripts/commands cause the job to fail. Failures during input download or output upload also cause job failure.
- **Stdout/stderr:** Captured and available in the job's JSON logfile under [`.grace/logs/`](/docs/directory-layout/grace-internal/logs).

---

The `shell` job module provides powerful flexibility to integrate local processing and interactions with external systems directly into your Grace workflows.
