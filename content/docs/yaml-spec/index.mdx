title: YAML Specification
description: The grace.yml workflow file format and its components.
---

The `grace.yml` file is the heart of every Grace workflow. It uses a declarative YAML syntax to define your automation pipelines, specifying global configurations, z/OS dataset mappings, individual job steps, their dependencies, and how data flows between them.

This section provides a detailed reference for all the blocks, fields, and options available when constructing your `grace.yml` file. Understanding this specification will allow you to leverage the full power and flexibility of Grace.

## Core Structure

The `grace.yml` file is organized into distinct top-level sections that define different aspects of your workflow.

<Cards>
  <Card href="/docs/yaml-spec/config" title="Config Block">
    Define global settings for your workflow, including Zowe profiles,
    concurrency limits, toolchain defaults, and cleanup behavior.
  </Card>
  <Card href="/docs/yaml-spec/datasets" title="Datasets Block">
    Specify default z/OS dataset names (PDS/PDSE) for JCL, source code, and load
    libraries used by Grace.
  </Card>
  <Card href="/docs/yaml-spec/jobs" title="Jobs Block">
    Understand the overall structure of the `jobs` array and the common fields
    applicable to all job types, such as `name`, `type`, and `depends_on`.
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Job Definitions & Data Flow

Dive deeper into how jobs are defined, how they interact, and how data is managed.

<Cards>
  <Card href="/docs/yaml-spec/virtual-paths" title="Virtual Paths & Data Flow">
    Learn about Grace's virtual path prefixes (`src://`, `zos://`,
    `zos-temp://`, etc.) and how `inputs` and `outputs` define data dependencies
    and flow.
  </Card>
  <Card href="/docs/yaml-spec/jobs-zos-specifics" title="z/OS Job Specifics">
    Explore fields common to z/OS job types (`compile`, `linkedit`, `execute`),
    such as `jcl` source definition, `program` specification, and `overrides`
    for toolchains.
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Job Type Specifications

Detailed reference for the parameters and behavior of each built-in job type.

<Cards>
  <Card href="/docs/yaml-spec/jobs/compile" title="Compile Jobs">
    Configuration for compiling source code (e.g., COBOL, PL/I) on z/OS.
  </Card>
  <Card href="/docs/yaml-spec/jobs/linkedit" title="Link-Edit Jobs">
    Configuration for link-editing object code into executable load modules.
  </Card>
  <Card href="/docs/yaml-spec/jobs/execute" title="Execute Jobs">
    Configuration for running programs or batch jobs on z/OS.
  </Card>
  <Card href="/docs/yaml-spec/jobs/shell" title="Shell Jobs">
    Configuration for executing local shell commands and scripts, including the
    `with` block.
  </Card>
</Cards>
