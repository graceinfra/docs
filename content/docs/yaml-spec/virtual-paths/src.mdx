title: src://
---

```yaml
path: src://<filepath_within_src_directory>
```

Refers to files located within your Grace project's local `src/` directory. This prefix is primarily used for source code (COBOL. PL/I, copybooks), JCL templates, scripts, or any other project-local file that needs to be uploaded to the mainframe as part of a PDS member or used by a local `shell` job.

---

# Resolution

- **Local file:** Grace looks for `<filepath_within_src_directory>` inside the `src/` directory, which is expected to be at the same level as your `grace.yml` file.
  - e.g. If `grace.yml` is in `myproject/` and `path` is `src://programs/main.cbl`, Grace looks for `myproject/src/programs/main.cbl`.
- **Mainframe PDS member (for z/OS job inputs):**

  - When used as an input to a z/OS job module (`compile`, `linkedit`, `execute`), [`grace deck`](/docs/cli-reference/deck) uploads the local file to the PDS specified in `datasets.src` ([globally](/docs/yaml-spec/datasets#src) or via job-level [override](/docs/yaml-spec/jobs#overrides)).
  - The PDS member name is derived from the filename part of `<filepath_within_src_directory>` by converting it to uppercase and removing extensions (e.g. `main.cbl` becomes `MAIN`). Grace's PDS member name validation rules apply.
  - e.g. `src://programs/main.cbl` might resolve to `YOUR.HLQ.SRC(MAIN)` on the mainframe.

# Typical usage examples

Compile mainframe source:

```yaml
datasets:
  src: "MYUSER.PROJECT.SOURCE"
jobs:
  - name: COMPILEIT
    type: compile
    inputs:
      - name: SYSIN
        path: src://app/main.cbl # Uploaded by 'deck' to MYUSER.PROJECT.SOURCE(MAIN)
```

Execute a local script from `src/`:

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: RUNLOCALSCRIPT
    type: shell
    with:
      script: src://utils/setup_env.sh # Executes ./src/utils/setup_env.sh
```

Shell job consuming a local `src/` file:

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: PARSECONFIG
    type: shell
    with:
      inline: 'python3 process_cfg.py --config "$GRACE_INPUT_APPCONFIG"'
    inputs:
      - name: APPCONFIG
        path: src://config/app_settings.json
        # $GRACE_INPUT_APPCONFIG resolves to ./src/config/app_settings.json
```

Shell job generating a file into `src/`:

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: CODEGEN
    type: shell
    with:
      script: src://tools/generate_copybook.py
    outputs:
      - name: NEWCOPY
        path: src://copybooks/newlayout.cpy
        # Script writes to $GRACE_OUTPUT_NEWCOPY -> ./src/copybooks/newlayout.cpy
```

# Key considerations

- The `grace deck` command handles the upload of `src://` files **only when they are defined as `inputs` to z/OS job types.**
- When `src://` is used with `shell` jobs (for `with.script`, `inputs`, or `outputs`), it refers to paths within the local `src/` directory of your Grace project.
- Ensure filenames within `src/` that are intended for mainframe PDS members are convertible to [valid member names](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/engineering-lifecycle-management-suite/workflow-management/7.0.3?topic=definitions-zos-data-set-naming-rules) (Grace uppercases and removes file extensions such as `.cbl`, `.cpy`).
