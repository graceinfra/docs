title: file://

```yaml
path: file://somefile.txt # Path relative to grace.yml
# or
path: file:///home/user/somefile.txt # Absolute path
```

The `file://` prefix refers to files on the **local filesystem where Grace is being executed**. It's used for:

- Providing local data files, configuration files, or other resources as input to `shell` jobs.
- Specifying explicit local file paths where `shell` jobs should write their output.
- Referencing local JCL files or JCL templates when using the [`job.jcl`]() field (e.g. `jcl://./mycustom.jcl`).

# Resolution

- **Local file path:**

  - If the path following `file://` starts with `./` or is a relative path (e.g. `data/input.csv`), Grace resolves it relative to the Grace workflow directory (containing `grace.yml`).
    - e.g. `path: file://./config/settings.dat` in `myproject/grace.yml` resolves to `myproject/config/settings.dat`
  - If the path is an absolute path (e.g. `/tmp/absolute_file.log` or `/home/user/file.txt`), Grace uses that absolute path directly.
    - e.g. `path: file:///var/log/app_extract.log`

- **Interaction with z/OS job modules (`compile`, `linkedit`, `execute`):**

  - **As an `input`:**

    When `file://<local_path>` is specified as an `input` for a z/OS job type, **Grace does not upload this to the mainframe during `grace deck`**. Consequently, Grace's default JCL templates cannot generate a DD statement that directly allows a mainframe job to access this local file.

    To use the content of such a file as input to a z/OS job, you should typically use a preceding `shell` job to stage this file (e.g. by outputting to a `zos-temp://` or `zos://` path, which is then consumed by the z/OS job).

    ```yaml
    jobs:
      - name: STAGEFILE
        type: shell
        with:
          # This script could validate, transform, or just copy the file
          inline: 'cp "$GRACE_INPUT_LOCALSOURCE" "$GRACE_OUTPUT_MAINFRAMEREADY"'
        inputs:
          - name: LOCALSOURCE
            path: file://./data/raw_input.txt
        outputs:
          - name: MAINFRAMEREADY
            path: zos-temp://staged_input_for_mf.txt # Grace uploads this

      - name: ZOS_PROCESS
        type: execute
        depends_on: [STAGEFILE]
        inputs:
          - name: SYSIN
            path: zos-temp://staged_input_for_mf.txt # Consumes the uploaded file
    # ...
    ```

    Here, the `shell` job accesses the `file://` input locally, and its output (`zos-temp://`) is now usable by a downstream z/OS job.

    > ⚠️ This is subject to change. Functionality for passing a `file://` path directly in a z/OS job `inputs` block is in development.

  - **As an `output`:**

    If `file://<local_path>` is specified as an `output` for a z/OS job type, Grace does **not** automatically download the corresponding dataset to this local `file://` path after the z/OS job completes. Similar to the above example, a subsequent `shell` job would be needed to perform such a download.

    > ⚠️ This is subject to change. Functionality for passing a `file://` path directly in a z/OS job `outputs` block is in development.

- **Interaction with `shell` job modules:**

  - **As an `input`:** The `GRACE_INPUT_*` environment variable exposed to the shell script will contain the resolved absolute local path to the file.
  - **As an `output`:** The `GRACE_OUTPUT_*` environment variable will contain the resolved absolute local path where the shell script is expected to write this output file.

# Typical usage examples

Input to a `shell` job:

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: PROCESSLOCALDATA
    type: shell
    with:
      script: ./scripts/process_local.py
    inputs:
      - name: USER_DATA # Exposed to the script as $GRACE_INPUT_USER_DATA
        path: file://./input_files/user_data.csv
```

Output from a `shell` job to a specific local file:

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: GENERATEREPORT
    type: shell
    with:
      inline: 'run_report_generator > "$GRACE_OUTPUT_FINALREPORT"' # Note: Ensure quotes if path has spaces
    outputs:
      - name: FINALREPORT # Exposed to the script as $GRACE_OUTPUT_FINALREPORT
        path: file://./output/reports/monthly_sales.html # Script writes to this resolved local path
```

Using a local JCL file/template for a z/OS job:

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: CUSTOMCOMPILE
    type: compile
    jcl: file://./my_jcl_templates/custom_compile_template.jcl.tmpl # Grace reads this for JCL
    program: MYPROG
    # ... other inputs/outputs for the compile job
```

Staging a local file for mainframe use via a `shell` job:

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: STAGELOCALFILE
    type: shell
    with:
      inline: 'cp "$GRACE_INPUT_SOURCEFILE" "$GRACE_OUTPUT_MFREADY"'
    inputs:
      - name: SOURCEFILE
        path: file://./data/input_for_mf.txt
    outputs:
      - name: MFREADY # This output is staged locally by the shell job
        path: zos-temp://staged.from.local.txt # Grace uploads content of $GRACE_OUTPUT_MFREADY to this temp DSN

  - name: ZOSJOB_USES_STAGED
    type: execute
    depends_on: [STAGELOCALFILE]
    inputs:
      - name: JOBINPUT
        path: zos-temp://staged.from.local.txt # Consumes the uploaded data
    # ...
```

# Key considerations

- **Scope of access:** `file://` paths always refer to the filesystem accessible by the machine running the `grace` command.
- **`grace deck` and uploads for z/OS job inputs:**
  - `grace deck` **does not** automatically upload files referenced by `file://` in [`job.inputs`](/docs/yaml-spec/jobs#inputs) when those inputs are for z/OS job types. Use an intermediate `shell` job (outputting to `zos-temp://` or `zos://`) if a downstream z/OS job needs this as an input.
  - When `file://` is used for `job.jcl`, `grace deck` reads this local file (populates it with template vars if applicable) and uploads the resulting JCL content to `datasets.jcl(JOBNAME)`
- **`grace run/submit` and downloads for z/OS job outputs:**
  - Grace **does not** automatically download mainframe dataset outputs to local `file://` paths declared in z/OS job `outputs`. A subsequent `shell` job is required to perform such a download.
- **`shell` job I/O:** For `shell` jobs, `GRACE_INPUT_*` and `GRACE_OUTPUT_*` environment variables provide the direct, resolved local file paths for the script's use.
- **Portability:** Using relative paths (e.g. `file://data/file.txt`) within your `grace.yml` generally makes your workflow more portable, assuming the relative directory structure is maintained alongside `grace.yml`. Absolute paths can limit portability.
