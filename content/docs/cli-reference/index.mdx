The Grace Command Line Interface (CLI) is your primary tool for interacting with Grace workflows. It allows you to initialize new projects, validate configurations, prepare mainframe artifacts, and execute your orchestration pipelines.

Each command is designed to be intuitive and provide clear feedback. Use the `-h` or `--help` flag with any command or subcommand for specific assistance.
