description: Submit a Grace workflow for asynchronous background execution.
---

The `grace submit` command initiates the orchestration of a workflow from your `grace.yml` file in an **asynchronous, detached background process**. This allows you to submit long-running workflows without tying up your terminal session.

Grace launches a new instance of itself in a specific background mode to manage the full orchestration, including dependency management, job submission, monitoring, and logging, identical to how [`grace run`](/docs/cli-reference/run) operates. The `grace submit` command itself returns quickly after successfully launching this background process.

> Like `grace run`, `grace submit` assumes that all necessary JCL and source files have already been prepared and uploaded to the mainframe, typically by using the [`grace deck`](/docs/cli-reference/deck) command. It does not perform any JCL generation or file uploads.

# Usage

```bash
grace submit [flags]
```

## Arguments

`grace submit` does not take any direct arguments other than flags. It operates on the `grace.yml` file in the current directory by default.

## Flags

### `--only [job_names]`

- Specify one or more job names to execute in the background workflow. Only these jobs (and their precedent dependencies) will be submitted and run.
- If multiple jobs are specified, separate them with commas or use the flag multiple times.
- Example: `grace submit --only DEPLOYBATCH`
- Example: `grace submit --only STEP1,STEP3`
- The background process will manage the execution of these targeted jobs and their dependencies.

### `-v`, `--verbose`

- Optional boolean flag.
- When `grace submit` is run, this flag enables verbose logging **for the `submit` command itself** to `stderr` as it launches the background process.
- **Crucially, it also passes a `--verbose` flag to the detached background Grace process**, causing the detailed `workflow.log` in the log directory to be written at a DEBUG level. This is highly recommended for troubleshooting background runs.
- This is a global flag inherited by all Grace commands.

### `-h`, `--help`

- Displays help information for the `submit` command.

# What it does

When you execute `grace submit`, it:

1.  **Loads and validates workflow:** Performs an initial load and validation of the `grace.yml` file to catch basic errors before attempting to launch a background process.
2.  **Creates log directory:** A new unique, timestamped log directory is created under `.grace/logs/` (e.g., `.grace/logs/YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS_submit_[workflow-uuid]/`). This directory is where the background process will store all its logs.
3.  **Determines Grace executable path:** Finds the path to the currently running `grace` executable.
4.  **Prepares background arguments:** Constructs a set of internal arguments to pass to the new Grace process, including:
    - `--internal-run`: A hidden flag that tells the new Grace instance to run in background orchestration mode.
    - `--workflow-id`: The unique ID generated for this workflow run.
    - `--cfg-path`: The absolute path to the `grace.yml` file being used.
    - `--log-dir`: The absolute path to the log directory created in step 2.
    - `--only` flags, if specified by the user, are passed through.
    - `--verbose` flag, if specified by the user, is passed through.
5.  **Launches detached background process:**
    - Executes a new instance of the `grace` command with the prepared internal arguments.
    - This new process is **detached** from the current terminal session (e.g., using `setsid` on Unix-like systems). This means it will continue to run even if you close your terminal or log out.
    - Standard input, output, and error streams of the background process are disassociated from the terminal.
6.  **Prints confirmation:** The `grace submit` command then prints a confirmation message to your terminal, typically including the Workflow ID and the path to the log directory, and exits.

**The Detached Background Process then performs actions similar to `grace run`:**

- Configures its logging to write to `workflow.log` within its assigned log directory.
- Builds the execution graph.
- Resolves paths.
- Orchestrates job execution (submitting to z/OS, running shell scripts).
- Logs detailed job execution records (`JOBID_JOBNAME.json`) and a final `summary.json` within its log directory.
- Performs cleanup of temporary intermediate datasets.

# Output

- **Terminal** (from `grace submit` command):

  - Confirmation message upon successfully launching the background process.
  - The unique **Workflow ID** for the submitted run.
  - The **path to the log directory** where the background process will write its logs.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    ✓ Configuration "grace.yml" loaded and validated.
    INFO Logs for will be stored in: .grace/logs/20231027T143000_submit_[workflow-uuid]
    INFO Launching background process...
    ✓ Workflow submitted successfully.
      Workflow ID: [workflow-uuid]
      Logs will be written to: .grace/logs/20231027T143000_submit_[workflow-uuid]
    ```

- **File system** (generated by the background process):
  - A new directory in `.grace/logs/` named like `YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS_submit_workflow-uuid/`.
  - Inside this directory:
    - `workflow.log`: A detailed log of the entire background orchestration process. Verbosity depends on whether `-v` was used with `grace submit`.
    - Individual JSON log files for each job executed (e.g., `JOB01234_MYJOB.json`).
    - A `summary.json` file for the entire workflow run.
    - A `.local-staging/` subdirectory, if used by any `shell` jobs for data transfers.

# Examples

1.  Submit all jobs in `grace.yml` for background execution:

    ```bash
    grace submit
    ```

2.  Submit the workflow with verbose logging for the background process:

    ```bash
    grace submit -v
    ```

3.  Submit only the job named `LONGTASK` for background execution:

    ```bash
    grace submit --only LONGTASK
    ```

# Monitoring background workflows

Since `grace submit` returns immediately, you need other ways to monitor the workflow:

- **Check Log Files:** The primary method currently is to inspect the files in the log directory, especially `workflow.log` for overall progress and individual job logs for details.
- **`grace logs <workflow-id>` (Future):** A command to tail the logs of a submitted workflow.
- **`grace status <workflow-id>` (Future):** A command to query the status of a submitted workflow.

Use `grace submit` for workflows that you don't need to watch execute in real-time or for integrating Grace into automated scripts and CI/CD systems.
