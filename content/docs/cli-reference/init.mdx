title: grace init
description: Scaffold a new Grace workflow.
---

The `grace init` command scaffolds a new Grace workflow directory structure, making it easy to get started with a new project.

It creates a standard layout including a starter `grace.yml` configuration file, a `src/` directory for your source code (like COBOL programs), and a `.grace/` directory for Grace's operational outputs like generated JCL decks and logs.

---

# Usage

```sh
grace init [workspace-name] [flags]
```

## Arguments

Arguments

- `[workspace-name]` (optional):

  - If provided, Grace creates a new subdirectory with this name and scaffolds the workflow inside it.
  - If omitted, Grace attempts to initialize the workflow in the current directory. The workflow name for configuration purposes will default to the name of the current directory.

## Flags

### `--tutorial`

- Optional boolean flag.
- If specified, `grace init` scaffolds a pre-configured "Hello, Grace" tutorial workflow. This includes:
  - A `grace.yml` file with sample compile, link-edit, and execute jobs.
  - A `src/hello.cbl` COBOL program.
- This is a great way to quickly get a runnable example.
- Example: `grace init my-first-workflow --tutorial`

### `-h, --help`

- Displays help information for the init command.

## Interactive Prompt

When you run `grace init` (without `--tutorial` and potentially without a `workspace-name` if you want to configure the current directory), it launches an interactive TUI (Text-based User Interface) to help you populate key fields in the generated `grace.yml`:

1. Workflow Name:

- If you provided `[workspace-name]` on the command line, this field will be pre-filled with that name.
- If you didn't provide [workspace-name], it defaults to the current directory's name (you can change it). If you accept the default to use the current directory, Grace will initialize files directly in CWD.
- This name is used for the directory (if creating a new one) and as a default for some internal naming if not overridden elsewhere.

2. HLQ (High-Level Qualifier):

- The high-level qualifier your site uses for creating datasets (e.g., MYUSER, PROJ001).
- This will populate `datasets.jcl`, `datasets.src`, and `datasets.loadlib` in `grace.yml` using a pattern like `HLQ.WORKFLOW_NAME.JCL`.
- Defaults to IBMUSER if left blank.

3. Profile (Zowe CLI Profile):

- The name of the Zowe CLI profile Grace should use to connect to your z/OS system (e.g., `zosmf`, `my_lpar_profile`).
- This populates `config.profile` in `grace.yml`.
- Defaults to `zosmf` if left blank.

> You can navigate between fields using `Tab / Shift+Tab` or Arrow Keys, and submit with `Enter`. Press `Esc` or `Ctrl+C` to cancel.

## What it creates

Assuming you run `grace init my_workflow_proj`:

```sh
my_workflow_proj/
├── .grace/               # Internal directory for Grace operations
│   ├── deck/             # Stores JCL generated by 'grace deck'
│   └── logs/             # Stores logs and summaries from 'grace run/submit'
├── src/                  # Place your COBOL, PL/I, etc. source files here
│   └── (empty or tutorial files if --tutorial is used)
└── grace.yml             # Your main workflow definition file
```

If run without `[workspace-name]` in an existing directory, these files/folders will be scattered directly in the current location (Grace will warn if it's about to overwrite existing files/directories like `.grace` or `src`).

---

## After grace init

1. Navigate into your new workflow directory (if one was created).
2. **Review and edit** `grace.yml`:
   - Crucially, ensure config.profile matches your working Zowe CLI profile.
   - Adjust `datasets` (JCL, SRC, LOADLIB HLQs and names) to suit your z/OS environment and naming conventions.
   - Verify config.defaults.compiler and config.defaults.linker settings (PGM names, PARMs, STEPLIBs) match your site's COBOL compiler and Linkage Editor.
3. **Add source files**: Place your COBOL programs or other source files into the src/ directory.
4. **Validate**: Run grace lint to check your grace.yml for syntax and structural correctness.

You are now ready to define jobs and use commands like `grace deck` and `grace run`.
