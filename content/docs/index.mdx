title: Introduction
---

Grace is an **open source orchestration toolchain** for running hybrid workflows across mainframe and cloud systems.

It brings declarative config, modular jobs, and unified logging to the world of z/OS. With Grace, you define, run, and monitor cross-platform workflows using a single YAML file. No brittle JCL chains. No polling SDSF.

# Why Grace?

Mainframes power banking systems, government programs, transportation networks, and more. But automating against them is an exercise in frustration.

**Grace simplifies orchestration by codifying mainframe jobs in a shared, declarative format.** It gives teams a consistent way to define and run batch jobs, whether they're compiling COBOL, uploading to S3, or transforming data in Python.

# Built for hybrid teams

In many orgs, mainframe and cloud teams operate in silos. Mainframe engineers manage legacy systems; data engineers extract and load that data downstream. Grace bridges the gap.

- **Mainframe teams** use Grace to define extract and batch jobs.
- **Cloud teams** run ETL, trigger analytics, and chain cloud-native steps.
- **Platform teams** operate Grace as the orchestration layer in between.

By working on a central control plane, teams gain joint ownership of the full pipeline - from JES to RDS, shell script to SQL.

# What can you do with Grace?

If you've used Terraform, GitHub Actions, or Airflow, Grace will feel familiar.

With one workflow file, you can:

- Compile COBOL programs
- Run batch jobs with inputs and outputs
- Move datasets to cloud storage (e.g. S3)
- Trigger ETL pipelines and Python scripts
- Chain steps across z/OS, shell, and cloud platforms
- Monitor, retry, and log the whole operation from one place

# Who is Grace for?

Grace is for teams automating **around** the mainframe.

- **Mainframe engineers** tired of brittle JCL chains
- **Data and cloud engineers** who need reliable, repeatable handoffs
- **Platform teams** standardizing job orchestration across systems
- **Migration consultants** building reproducible flows for legacy workloads
- **Enterprises** modernizing incrementally, not all at once

# The name

Grace is named after [Grace Hopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper)â€”pioneer of COBOL and early advocate for human-readable programming. She believed programming should be accessible and expressive. We're bringing that same spirit to infrastructure automation, across the most enduring systems in computing history.
