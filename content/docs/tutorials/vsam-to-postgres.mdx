title: VSAM to Postgres
description: Learn how to extract VSAM data from a mainframe and push it into a relational database using Grace.
---

This tutorial walks you through a complete **VSAM-to-RDS pipeline** using Grace. You'll orchestrate:

1. Extracting VSAM data from z/OS using a COBOL job
2. Transforming it into CSV format
3. Uploading it to cloud object storage (e.g. S3)
4. Ingesting the data into an **AWS RDS** (PostgreSQL or MySQL) instance

All from a **single declarative `grace.yml`** file. No JCL editing, no glue scripts, no manual polling.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- ✅ A **Grace workspace** initialized with `grace init`
- ✅ A configured **Zowe CLI profile** with access to a z/OS system
- ✅ A working **COBOL transformation job** that reads VSAM and outputs fixed-format or delimited data
- ✅ AWS S3 bucket + IAM credentials (if using S3 as staging)
- ✅ An RDS instance with access credentials
- ✅ [Grace CLI installed](/docs/installation)
