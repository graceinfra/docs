title: Hello, Grace!
description: Cover the basics of the Grace CLI and get up and running with your first workflow.
---

We’ll start with a simple CI-style pipeline that automates compiling, linking, and executing a “Hello, Grace” COBOL program on z/OS.

# Prerequisites

- [Grace CLI](https://github.com/graceinfra/grace)

  See [Installation](/docs/installation) for instructions on getting Grace running on your machine.

- [Zowe CLI](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/getting-started/cli-getting-started)

  ```sh
  npm install -g @zowe/cli@zowe-v3-lts
  ```

  We recommend you install Zowe CLI v3 to ensure maximum compatibility.

- After installing Zowe CLI, be sure to install the following plugins.

  **These provide necessary functionality** for Grace and Hopper subprocesses to interact with z/OS services. The following plugins provide support for CICS, DB2, MQ, and z/OS FTP calls, and are **assumed to be installed by Grace**.

  ```sh
  zowe plugins install @zowe/cics-for-zowe-cli@zowe-v2-lts @zowe/db2-for-zowe-cli@zowe-v2-lts @zowe/mq-for-zowe-cli@zowe-v2-lts @zowe/zos-ftp-for-zowe-cli@zowe-v2-lts
  ```

# Scaffold a new workflow

The recommended way to create a new Grace workflow is with [grace init](/docs/cli-reference/init). This scaffolds all necessary subdirectories and starter files so you can focus on getting logic in motion.

```sh
workflow/
├── .grace/
│   ├── deck/
│   └── logs/
├── src/
└── grace.yml
```

Upon invoking `grace init`, you will be prompted to fill out optional fields for workflow configuration:

1. **Workflow name**: Leave this blank to use the current directory or populate it to create a new directory
2. **HLQ**: The high-level qualifier to use for creating datasets
3. **Profile**: The Zowe profile to use for this workflow

To get hands-on quickly, we'll use a built-in tutorial template that provides a populated `grace.yml` and "Hello, Grace" COBOL program ready for us to use:

```sh
grace init my-workflow --tutorial
```

> Invoking `grace init` with an argument pre-populates the workspace name field for scaffolding a new directory.

# Configure your environment

## Zowe config

Grace uses [Zowe](https://www.zowe.org/) for authentication. If you work with z/OS systems, you might already have this configured. If not, see [configuration](/docs/configuration) or [the official docs](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/web_help/docs/zowe_config_init.html).

You can test connection to your mainframe's z/OSMF service with:

```sh
zowe zosmf check status
```

## Grace config

Open your newly created workflow directory and inspect `grace.yml`.

This is where you

1. **Bind to a Zowe profile** (e.g. `zosmf, tso, global_base`)
2. **Set dataset prefixes** and name-patterns for your decks & outputs
3. **Configure your compiler/linker** options (COBOL copybooks, your site's `LOADLIB`, etc.)
4. **Architect an end-to-end workflow** chaining mainframe and cloud based jobs, controlling data lifetimes, and defining hooks for your integrations of choice

For now, simply ensure your compiler, linker, and dataset configurations match the expectations of **your target z/OS environment**. A typical `grace.yml` config section might look like this:

```yaml
config:
  profile: zosmf # your configured Zowe profile name
  defaults:
    compiler:
      pgm: IGYCRCTL # site-specific COBOL compiler
      parms: "OBJECT,NODECK,LIB"
      steplib: IGY.V6R4M0.SIGYCOMP # site-specific steplib
    linker:
      pgm: IEWL
      parms: "LIST,MAP,XREF"

datasets:
  jcl: IBMUSER.GRC.HELLO.JCL # target PDS for JCL
  src: IBMUSER.GRC.HELLO.SRC # target PDS for COBOL source files
  loadlib: IBMUSER.LOAD # site-specific loadlib
```

See the [YAML spec](/docs/yaml-spec) for more information on `grace.yml` fields.

Hint: You can run `grace lint` to validate your `grace.yml` syntax.

> Dataset identifiers must comply with z/OS dataset naming conventions. This means adhering to acceptable character counts, level limits, and special character restrictions. Refer to the [IBM documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/engineering-lifecycle-management-suite/workflow-management/7.1.0?topic=definitions-zos-data-set-naming-rules).

# Workflow overview

Once your environment is configured, Grace will look at the `jobs` section of your `grace.yml` to determine what to do. Each job defines a step in your pipeline, such as compiling source code, running scripts, moving files on and off the mainframe, or calling external APIs.

The tutorial workflow contains three jobs:

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: CMPHELLO
    type: compile
    inputs:
      - name: SYSIN
        path: src://hello.cbl
    outputs:
      - name: SYSLIN
        path: zos-temp://hello.obj

  - name: LNKHELLO
    type: linkedit
    depends_on: [CMPHELLO]
    program: HELLO
    inputs:
      - name: SYSLIN
        path: zos-temp://hello.obj

  - name: RUNHELLO
    type: execute
    depends_on: [LNKHELLO]
    program: HELLO
```

> Job names **must** be uppercase, a maximum of **8 characters long**, and adhere to **z/OS PDS member naming conventions**. See [z/OS data set naming rules](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/engineering-lifecycle-management-suite/workflow-management/7.1.0?topic=definitions-zos-data-set-naming-rules).

- **CMPHELLO**
  - Invokes the COBOL compiler with the local file `./src/hello.cbl` as input.
  - Produces an object file (`hello.obj`).
- **LNKHELLO**
  - Takes the object file and links it into an executable load module named `HELLOGRC`.
  - This step depends on the compile job.
- **RUNHELLO**
  - Executes the `HELLOGRC` program on z/OS.
  - This is the final step, and it depends on the link job completing successfully.

To dive deeper, see [YAML Spec - Jobs](/docs/yaml-spec/jobs) for job types, configuring dependencies and concurrency, and advanced chaining techniques.

> `zos-temp://` is a platform agnostic virtual mount path. It denotes intermediate datasets between jobs that are handled behind the scenes by Grace. The engine will provision datasets, wire dependencies, and handle cleanup automatically.
>
> In a production workflow, you might have many `zos-temp://` and `local-temp://` paths performing file handoff between mainframe operations, cloud endpoints, local scripts, and so on.
>
> To learn more about how this works, see [Virtual Paths & Job I/O](/docs/yaml-spec/virtual-paths).

# Generate your job deck

Once your environment is configured, you're ready to **dynamically compile JCL and sync your workflow** to the mainframe.

```sh
grace deck
```

This will:

- **Parse** your `grace.yml`
- **Generate JCL** for each job in `.grace/deck/`
- **Ensure target datasets exist** and provision them automatically if not
- **Upload COBOL source files and JCL** to the appropriate z/OS datasets

> `grace deck` is **idempotent**. You can run it repeatedly to sync local workflow files to the mainframe without triggering job execution.

You can inspect the `.grace/deck/` directory to view the JCL that will be submitted for each job. You can then fine tune them and run `grace deck --no-compile` to sync your local files **without overwriting them**.

Grace pulls from a repository of pre-built JCL templates for each step type - letting you focus on your architecture, not JCL syntax errors.

---

# Run your workflow

Now that your source and JCL are uploaded, you're ready to run your new end-to-end workflow!

```sh
grace run
```

This will:

- **Submit your jobs** to the mainframe in order
- **Write structured JSON logs** into `.grace/logs/`
- **Monitor return codes** and stream **logs and lifecycle status** in the terminal

> If you are curious about what orchestration looks like in a hosted or asynchronous environment, see [grace submit](/docs/cli-reference/submit).

> `grace run` does not upload or regenerate anything. It purely handles workflow orchestration and monitoring with the last datasets you decked.

# Big Iron just learned a new trick

We just orchestrated a **multi-step z/OS COBOL workflow**, from compiling and linking to execution and log collection, **using a single declarative YAML file**.

You didn't have to:

- **Manually write and maintain** brittle JCL for each step
- **Allocate and clean up** temporary datasets
- Submit jobs **one at a time and poll SDSF** for return codes
- **Copy logs and outputs** back from the mainframe
- Explain to your team why you spent 2 hours debugging DD statements

Grace abstracts all of this into an **automated, version-controllable workflow**, easily shared across teams and reusable across environments and business cases. Need to update your source file? Just run `grace deck`. Want to test a different input dataset? Just edit `grace.yml`. Integrate workflow triggers in your event driven architecture? (We're working on it) 😉.

**Welcome to modern DevOps on the mainframe.** You're on your way to building cross-platform **automation, pipelines, and tooling** with the same principles you'd use to deploy a container or cloud function.
