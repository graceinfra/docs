title: Introduction

Grace is an **open source infrastructure-as-code (IaC) toolchain** for mainframe job orchestration and hybrid cloud automation.

Built for modern developers and mainframe engineers alike, Grace abstracts JCL and z/OS complexity behind a **declarative YAML workflow format**, allowing you to define, run, and monitor mainframe jobs the same way you'd deploy containers or cloud services.

## Why Grace?

Mainframes remain the backbone of the global economy, running critical workloads in banking, government, transportation, and beyond. But the developer experience for these systems hasn't kept pace with the rest of the industry.

- JCL is brittle, verbose, and difficult to manage
- Workflow logic is hidden in monolithic scripts or job chains
- Devs spend hours polling SDSF, wrangling DD statements, and debugging allocation errors
- Integration with modern toolchains requires fragile glue code or manual intervention

**Grace exists to fix this.**

We believe automating against the mainframe should be:

- **Composable** - each step isolated, portable, and testable
- **Declarative** - defined as code, version-controlled, peer-reviewed
- **Observable** - rich logging, lifecycle status, and return code tracking
- **Integrated** - able to chain mainframe jobs with Python scripts, shell commands, S3 uploads, and more

## What can you do with Grace?

Grace is designed to feel familiar to anyone who’s worked with tools like Terraform, GitHub Actions, or Airflow.

With a single YAML file, you can:

- Compile COBOL programs
- Link-edit and deploy load modules
- Run batch jobs with dynamic inputs and outputs
- Automate mainframe-native data transformations
- Trigger cloud services from a z/OS job
- Orchestrate pipelines across mainframe and non-mainframe infrastructure

## Who is Grace for?

- **Admins** looking to automate atomic parts of their workload
- **Mainframe developers** tired of fragile, repetitive job setup
- **Platform teams** looking to standardize job orchestration
- **Modern devs** integrating z/OS into cloud-native pipelines
- **Enterprises** migrating workloads and seeking tooling parity
- **Anyone** who thinks automating 50-year-old systems shouldn’t require 50-year-old patterns

## The name

Grace is named in honor of [Grace Hopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper)—COBOL pioneer and one of the first modern computing architects. We like to think she'd be excited to see her ideas remixed with today’s infrastructure philosophies.
